## Terms
- **Population** = a collection of persons, things or objects under study
	- **Population parameter** = a number that is a property of the population (e.g. All heights of people in Australia).
	- **Sample** = A random sample of the population. We use a sample as it is too hard to collect all datapoints for a everyone in a population (e.g. Measuring all heights of people in Australia, we instead randomly sample a group that can accurately represent that population). A sample that represents the population well is known as a **representative sample.**
		- **Statistic** = A number that represents a property of the sample that is an estimate of the population parameter (e.g. Average height of people in our sample).
- **Variable** = A characteristic of interest for each person of thing within a given a population usually notated with capital letters (e.g. X, Y, Z). Variables can either be:
	- **Numeric** = takes values with equal units (e.g. height in cm, weight in kg)
	- **Categorical** = places the person or thing into a category (e.g. Male/Female)
	- **Data** = Actual values of a variable
		- **Datum** = A single value
- **Mean** = sum of terms / number of terms
- **Proportion** = count of successes / size of population
