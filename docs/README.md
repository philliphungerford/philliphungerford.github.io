My personal data science page. This is really a reference page for me that I hope others can use when they want to learn or brush up on some data science /statistics skills.

## SETUP
You are currently using Obsidian as a CMS.

Each page you setup with have its own directory with an _images dir for any images you wish to show on that page. For example:
- page directory
  - _images directory
  - page.md
