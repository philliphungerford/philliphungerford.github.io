# Welcome!

I have always been passionate about improving the health and well-being of those around me. It was during my undergraduate statistics units in Psychology and Criminology that I discovered the power of data and how good data can allow for powerful inferences and applications in the health sector. 



This site is all about health related data and how we can best analyse it using a range of data science tools. These include statistical analysis, visualisation tools and machine learning.
